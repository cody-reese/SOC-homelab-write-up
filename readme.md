## Introduction

Applying cybersecurity principles can be challenging without a practical and secure environment. This homelab aims to bridge that gap by guiding you through the setup, optimization, and securing of a small-scale IT infrastructure. The skills and knowledge you gain here are directly applicable to larger, enterprise-level systems.

## What is a Homelab?

A Homelab is a personal sandbox environment that is custom configured for hands-on learning and skill development in a specific field. It simulates components and systems found in larger infrastructures, providing a safe and controlled environment to experiment and understand how they function.

## Lab Components

Hereâ€™s what this Homelab will include:

- **VirtualBox**: Setting up VirtualBox to serve as the hypervisor.
- **Configuring pfSense**: Implementing network segmentation and security using pfSense.
- **Setting Up Security Onion**: Utilizing Security Onion as an integrated solution for IDS, security monitoring, and log management.
- **Configuring Kali Linux**: Establishing Kali Linux as the attack machine.
- **Setting Up Windows Server**: Configuring a Windows Server as a Domain Controller.
- **Configuring Windows Desktops**
- **Setting Up Splunk**
- **Adding Linux Machines**: Incorporating Ubuntu, CentOS, Metasploitable, DVWA, and Vulnhub machines for purposes such as exploitation, detection, or monitoring.

This guide will help you build and refine your cybersecurity skills within a practical and controlled environment.
