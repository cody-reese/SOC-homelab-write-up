# Creating a Homelab for Network Monitoring and Security Analysis

Welcome to the guide on creating a Cybersecurity Homelab focused on detection and monitoring. Due to recent updates and changes in software components, I’m unable to offer technical support for this lab at the moment. However, keep an eye out for a future, scalable version of this lab in the cloud!

## Introduction

Applying cybersecurity principles can be daunting without a practical and secure environment. This homelab aims to bridge that gap by guiding you through the setup, optimization, and securing of a small-scale IT infrastructure. The skills and knowledge you gain here are directly applicable to larger, enterprise-level systems.

## What is a Homelab?

A Homelab is a personal sandbox environment that is custom configured for hands-on learning and skill development in a specific field. It simulates components and systems found in larger infrastructures, providing a safe and controlled environment to experiment and understand how they function.

## Lab Components

Here’s what this Homelab will include:

- **VirtualBox**: Setting up VirtualBox to serve as the hypervisor.
- **Configuring pfSense**: Implementing network segmentation and security using pfSense.
- **Setting Up Security Onion**: Utilizing Security Onion as an integrated solution for IDS, security monitoring, and log management.
- **Configuring Kali Linux**: Establishing Kali Linux as the attack machine.
- **Setting Up Windows Server**: Configuring a Windows Server as a Domain Controller.
- **Configuring Windows Desktops**
- **Setting Up Splunk**
- **Adding Linux Machines**: Incorporating Ubuntu, CentOS, Metasploitable, DVWA, and Vulnhub machines for purposes such as exploitation, detection, or monitoring.

This guide will help you build and refine your cybersecurity skills within a practical and controlled environment.
